To launch the game, download the .zip containing the executable and other files, extract and run
The game is very sparse in features:
	- the moment you launch it, the game starts
	- you must protect your brain from the cans (white rectangles)
	- you are the orange thingy
	- your cursor is the red thingy
	- move with wasd, shoot with space
	- it freezes whenever your brain damage (light gray number) reaches 10; you must close the game by pressing Esc, and launch it again to start over
	- you can see your score in green
